I managed to stick to my diet plan and complete all my scheduled tasks. The morning workout gave me a boost of energy that lasted throughout the day. I did experience a slight headache in the afternoon, possibly due to dehydration. I'll make sure to drink more water tomorrow. The new meditation technique I tried before bed seemed to help with relaxation. Looking forward to seeing if it improves my sleep quality over time."
